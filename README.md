# The CSDMS Help Desk

The **CSDMS Help Desk**
is where you can get questions
about products and services provided by the
[Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System](https://csdms.colorado.edu)
answered by CSDMS Integration Facility (CIF) staff.
The Help Desk provides tracking and an audit trail for your questions.
Plus, the responses are searchable,
so the question you ask may help another CSDMS member in the future.

Here's how it works.

1. If you haven't already done so, sign up for GitHub: https://github.com/join.

1. Go to https://github.com/csdms/help-desk/issues (or select the **Issues** tab above).

1. Select the **New Issue** button.

1. Ask us a question. Provide a brief title, then give more detail in space below. You can use text formatting, links, and images in your description.

1. When you're finished, select the **Submit New Issue** button. A CIF staff member will respond to your question. You'll be notified by email (through your GitHub account) of activity on your question.

Help us build a public knowledge base for our community!
