# The CSDMS Help Desk

The **CSDMS Help Desk**
is where you can get answers for questions about the products and services of the
[Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System][csdms].
The Help Desk provides tracking and an audit trail for your questions.
Plus, the responses are searchable,
so the questions you ask may help another CSDMS member in the future.

The Help Desk uses [GitHub][github],
so if you don't yet have an account,
please [sign up][github-join].

<a href="https://github.com/csdms/help-desk/issues/new/choose" class="button">Ask a question</a>

When asking a question, please provide a brief title, then give more detail in the text area.
You can use text formatting, web links, and images in your description. ([Learn more][github-text] about text formatting on GitHub.)
A CSDMS staff member will respond to your question. You'll be notified by email (through your GitHub account) of activity on your question.

Help us build a public knowledge base for our community!
